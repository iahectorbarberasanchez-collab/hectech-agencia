# Hectech AI Agency - Setup

## Supabase Configuration

To make the contact form work, create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

You can find these keys in your Supabase Project Settings -> API.
